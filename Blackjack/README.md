<h1>Black Jack Game</h1>

This game is made in python with <strong>150</strong> lines of code. It utilizes classess to have an orginzied codebase.

<h2>The game works like this</h2>

There are three rounds. Each round you get 2 cards from the deck and you can see one of the dealers cards. You choose to hit or stand. If you get over 21 you are busted and the dealer gets a point. 

After each round the deck mixes itself so it's a new deck. After all 3 rounds whoever got the most points wins.

- The dealer chooses to hit or stand at random using the random.choice().
- An ace can be an 11 or 1 depending on what you need.
- Colors have been added so it's easier to see on the terminal.

Working on an AI model for the dealer and a GUI version using pygame/tkinter.
